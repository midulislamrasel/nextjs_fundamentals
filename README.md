## How to set up a Next.js project
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Automatic installation
We recommend starting a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:
```angular2html
npx create-next-app@latest
```
### Manual installation
To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

```angular2html
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```
## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
